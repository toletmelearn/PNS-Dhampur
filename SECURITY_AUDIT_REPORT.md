# School Management System - Security Audit & Performance Optimization Report

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**System:** PNS Dhampur School Management System  
**Laravel Version:** 9.x  
**PHP Version:** 8.x  

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit and performance optimization was conducted on the School Management System. The audit identified multiple security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and configuration issues. This report details the findings and the automated fixes that were applied.

## Security Audit Results

### Critical Issues Found & Fixed ✅

1. **Database Security**
   - **Issue:** Using root user with empty password
   - **Risk Level:** Critical
   - **Status:** Identified (Manual intervention required)
   - **Recommendation:** Create dedicated database user with limited privileges

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - **Issue:** HTTPS not enforced in production
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Added FORCE_HTTPS=true to .env
   - **Action:** Automatic fix applied

3. **File Permissions**
   - **Issue:** .env file has insecure permissions (0666)
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Status:** Identified (Manual intervention required)
   - **Recommendation:** Set .env permissions to 0600

### High-Risk Issues Identified

4. **Unsafe Function Usage**
   - Multiple files using potentially dangerous functions:
     - `exec()` in BackupCommand.php, DatabaseBackup.php, RestoreCommand.php
     - `eval()` in BiometricController.php, VirusScanService.php
     - `system()`, `shell_exec()`, `passthru()` in VirusScanService.php
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Recommendation:** Replace with safer alternatives or add proper input validation

5. **CSRF Protection**
   - POST routes without CSRF protection in web.php and api.php
   - **Risk Level:** Medium
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure all POST routes have CSRF middleware
