# User Role Permissions Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the permission structure and access levels for each user role in the PNS-Dhampur School Management System. It serves as a reference for administrators and developers to understand the role hierarchy and permission model.

## Role Hierarchy
The system implements a hierarchical role structure where higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower-level roles:

1. **Super Admin** (Highest level)
2. **Admin**
3. **Principal**
4. **Teacher**
5. **Parent**
6. **Student** (Lowest level)

## Access Control Implementation

The system implements role-based access control through:

1. **Middleware**: Route-level permission checks
2. **Policy Classes**: Resource-specific permission logic
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Automatic permission inheritance
4. **UI Adaptation**: Dynamic interface based on user role

## Recommended Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users should only have access to what they need
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user roles and permissions
3. **Role Separation**: Maintain clear boundaries between role responsibilities
4. **Documentation**: Keep this document updated as roles and permissions change

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Permissions**: Further refinement of permission structure
2. **Custom Roles**: Allow creation of custom roles with specific permissions
3. **Permission Groups**: Group related permissions for easier management
4. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced tracking of permission-related activities
