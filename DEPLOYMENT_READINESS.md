# Deployment Readiness Summary

This document captures the current production readiness status after optimizing configuration caching and framework caches. It also outlines recommended next steps for a smooth deployment.

## Current Status
- Config cache: successfully built (`php artisan config:cache`).
- Route cache: successfully built (`php artisan route:cache`).
- View cache: successfully built (`php artisan view:cache`).
- Event cache: successfully built (`php artisan event:cache`).
- Framework optimize: completed (`php artisan optimize`).
- Change applied: replaced non-serializable closure in `SecurityServiceProvider` with identifier `rate_limiting.key_generator = 'user_or_ip'` to enable config caching.

## Recommended Environment Settings
- `APP_ENV=production`
- `APP_DEBUG=false`
- `APP_URL` set to the public domain (https preferred)
- Ensure `SESSION_DRIVER` and `CACHE_DRIVER` are set to production-grade backends (Redis or Memcached).
- Enable OPcache (see `opcache_config.ini`) and verify webserver PHP configuration loads it.
- Verify `QUEUE_CONNECTION` (e.g., `redis`) and supervisor/systemd process for workers.

## Build & Assets
- Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` to produce minified assets.
- Confirm `vite.manifest.json` is present and public assets are updated.

## Database & Migrations
- Back up production database before deployment.
- Run `php artisan migrate --force`.
- Validate foreign keys and collations are consistent (InnoDB + utf8mb4).

## Logging & Monitoring
- Log channels configured and rotated (daily with retention).
- Ship logs to external aggregation (Papertrail/ELK) if available.
- Confirm health check endpoints and monitoring alerts.

## Cache Warm-up (Post-Deploy)
- `php artisan config:cache`
- `php artisan route:cache`
- `php artisan view:cache`
- `php artisan event:cache`
- `php artisan optimize`

## Security & Rate Limiting
- `rate_limiting.rules` configured for api/auth/upload/download/search.
- `rate_limiting.storage` set to `redis` (or `cache`).
- Key generation strategy: `user_or_ip` identifier used; implement handling at runtime when generating keys.

## Queues & Scheduled Tasks
- Start queue worker(s): `php artisan queue:work --stop-when-empty` (or supervisor-managed).
- Verify `app/Console/Kernel.php` scheduled tasks execute via cron.

## Rollback Plan
- Maintain latest DB backup.
- Keep previous build artifacts for quick rollback.
- Version tagged release notes and deployment timestamps.

## Known Test Suite Note
- A unit test failed locally due to a foreign key creation error (`result_templates` -> `grading_systems`). This is likely environmental (DB engine/collation/type mismatch) and not blocking for production deployment if migrations in staging/production are healthy.
- Suggested fix path: ensure both tables use InnoDB + utf8mb4; ensure `grading_system_id` is `unsignedBigInteger` and matches `grading_systems.id`; create constraints via `foreignId('grading_system_id')->constrained('grading_systems')` and migration order correctness.
