# PNS-Dhampur Performance Testing Plan

## 1. Performance Metrics and Benchmarks

### Response Time Thresholds
- API endpoints: < 500ms response time
- Page loads: < 2 seconds for critical pages (login, dashboard, attendance)
- Report generation: < 5 seconds for standard reports
- PDF generation: < 10 seconds for complex reports

### Throughput Requirements
- Authentication system: 100 logins/second
- Attendance recording: 50 records/second
- Student registration: 20 registrations/second
- Report generation: 10 reports/second

### Resource Utilization Limits
- CPU: < 70% sustained utilization
- Memory: < 2GB per application instance
- Database connections: < 80% of connection pool
- Network bandwidth: < 70% of available capacity

### Error Rate Tolerance
- Critical operations: < 0.1% failure rate
- Non-critical operations: < 0.5% failure rate
- Timeout errors: < 0.2% of total requests

## 2. Test Scenarios

### Baseline Performance Testing
- Measure performance with single user for all critical operations
- Establish baseline response times for all API endpoints
- Document database query execution times
- Record resource utilization under minimal load

### Load Testing
- Simulate 100 concurrent users for normal operations
- Test attendance recording with 50 simultaneous teachers
- Measure student registration with 20 concurrent admin users
- Test report generation with 10 simultaneous requests

### Stress Testing
- Increase load to 200% of expected capacity (200 concurrent users)
- Test system behavior at 300 concurrent users
- Identify breaking points for each critical module
- Measure recovery time after overload conditions

### Endurance Testing
- Run system at 70% capacity for 24 hours
- Monitor for memory leaks and resource degradation
- Test database connection stability over time
- Verify system stability during scheduled tasks (backups, reports)

### Spike Testing
- Simulate sudden increase from 10 to 100 users in 60 seconds
- Test morning attendance peak (8:00-9:00 AM)
- Simulate exam result publication traffic surge
- Test admission period registration spikes

### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Authentication Load Test**
   - Simulate 100 concurrent login attempts
   - Measure response time and success rate
   - Test password reset functionality under load

2. **Attendance Recording Performance**
   - Simulate 50 teachers submitting attendance simultaneously
   - Test bulk attendance submission (multiple classes)
   - Measure database write performance

3. **Student Registration Throughput**
   - Test batch registration of 100 students
   - Measure file upload performance for student documents
   - Test validation and error handling under load

4. **Report Generation Stress Test**
   - Generate multiple complex reports simultaneously
   - Test PDF generation performance
   - Measure memory usage during report generation

## 4. Monitoring Configuration

### Application Performance Monitoring
```php
// Add to .env file
PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD=1000
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=128
RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD=2000
PERFORMANCE_LOG_CHANNEL=performance
```

### Database Query Monitoring
- Enable slow query logging in MySQL
- Set threshold to 1000ms for development, 500ms for production
- Implement query timing middleware for critical operations

### Resource Utilization Tracking
- Configure server-level monitoring (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- Set up alerts for resource thresholds (70% warning, 90% critical)
- Implement application-level memory usage tracking

## 5. Success Criteria

### Critical Path Performance
- Login process: < 1 second end-to-end
- Attendance recording: < 2 seconds per submission
- Student profile access: < 1.5 seconds
- Report generation initiation: < 3 seconds

### System Stability Requirements
- 99.9% uptime during school hours (7 AM - 4 PM)
- Zero data loss during performance testing
- Graceful degradation under extreme load
- Self-recovery after spike conditions

### Scalability Benchmarks
- Linear scaling up to 500 concurrent users
- Support for 5,000 student records without performance degradation
- Ability to handle 10,000 attendance records per day
- Support for 1,000 report generations per day
